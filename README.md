# Decentralized Carbon Footprint Tracking

A blockchain-based platform for transparent, verifiable tracking and certification of corporate carbon emissions and reduction efforts.

## Overview

This decentralized application (dApp) leverages blockchain technology to create a trustless, immutable system for measuring, reporting, and verifying corporate greenhouse gas emissions. By utilizing smart contracts and cryptographic verification, the platform enables organizations to demonstrate genuine commitment to sustainability while eliminating greenwashing through transparent, auditable carbon accounting.

## System Architecture

The system consists of four primary smart contracts working together:

1. **Entity Registration Contract**
    - Records and verifies companies measuring their emissions
    - Manages organizational identity and metadata
    - Establishes permission structures for reporting and verification
    - Links entities to their historical emissions data and reduction commitments

2. **Methodology Verification Contract**
    - Validates calculation approaches for emissions measurement
    - Stores approved methodologies that adhere to international standards
    - Enables scientific review and certification of measurement techniques
    - Ensures consistency and comparability across reporting entities

3. **Emissions Reporting Contract**
    - Tracks greenhouse gas production over time
    - Secures immutable emissions records with timestamps
    - Categorizes emissions by scope (1, 2, and 3)
    - Supports detail breakdowns by department, facility, or activity

4. **Reduction Certification Contract**
    - Verifies successful emissions decreases against baselines
    - Issues digital certificates for validated reductions
    - Manages carbon credit generation and retirement
    - Provides proof of climate action and ESG compliance

## Key Features

- **Transparency**: All emissions data and reduction claims publicly verifiable on blockchain
- **Auditability**: Immutable record of all reported emissions and methodologies used
- **Standardization**: Alignment with global carbon accounting standards (GHG Protocol, ISO 14064, etc.)
- **Trust**: Third-party verification embedded in the protocol
- **Interoperability**: Compatible with carbon markets and existing ESG reporting frameworks
- **Incentivization**: Rewards for verified emissions reductions
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuous tracking rather than periodic reporting cycles

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Ethereum wallet (MetaMask recommended)
- ETH for gas fees or platform-specific tokens
- Organizational carbon measurement capability
- Digital identity solution for entity verification

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-organization/decentralized-carbon-tracking.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Configure your environment variables:
   ```
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   Edit the `.env` file with your specific configuration settings.

4. Deploy the contracts:
   ```
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network [your-network]
   ```

### Entity Registration Process

1. Connect your organization's wallet to the dApp
2. Complete the entity registration form with required details:
    - Organization name and identifier
    - Industry classification
    - Operational boundaries
    - Verification partners
3. Submit supporting documentation for identity verification
4. Pay the registration fee
5. Receive your organization's unique blockchain identifier

### Data Flow

1. Organization registers and establishes identity on the platform
2. Organization selects or submits methodology for emissions calculation
3. Third-party verifiers approve the methodology
4. Organization reports emissions data according to approved methodology
5. Verifiers validate reported emissions
6. System compares emissions against baselines to certify reductions
7. Reduction certificates are issued for verified decreases

## User Guides

### For Reporting Organizations

1. Register your organization and define operational boundaries
2. Select approved calculation methodologies or submit new ones for verification
3. Connect data sources for emissions tracking (manual or IoT/API integration)
4. Report emissions data at required intervals
5. Document reduction initiatives and expected impacts
6. Receive certification for verified emissions reductions
7. Share verification proofs with stakeholders

### For Verifiers and Auditors

1. Register as an approved verification entity
2. Review and approve/reject calculation methodologies
3. Validate emissions reports through data analysis and audit
4. Certify emissions reductions against established baselines
5. Issue verification statements on the blockchain

### For Regulators and Stakeholders
